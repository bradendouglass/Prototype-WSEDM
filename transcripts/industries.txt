Parking –

Parking is fast becoming a major part of everyday life in our shrinking world. Car parks are in every major city and at every major airport. Millions of dollars change hands on a daily basis. To control the volume of cars and dollars, car parks have turned to technology! Mag stripe technology has been used for years to control revenues and monitor traffic.

Magnetic stripe tickets and debit card systems allow car park operators to know quantity of autos in their car park, when they arrived, when they left and most importantly the duration of their stay! These systems help car park owners to process large amounts of information accurately. However, if your tickets do not perform, neither does your car park system. Come to EDM for quality magnetic striped cards and tickets.


Entertainment –

Have you gone to a concert or a sporting event lately? Chances are you had to wait in line for a ticket. Entertainment tickets are used to reserve your space at such an event. This is your proof that you have paid to get into a particular event. Many entertainment ticket providers have gone to the use of a magnetic striped ticket to help prevent counterfeiting.

Millions of dollars are lost each year to counterfeit tickets. A magnetic striped ticket helps to prevent such counterfeiting because the ticket is encoded at the time of issue. The magnetic stripe makes color copies useless! EDM has provided both standard and magnetic striped entertainment tickets for many customers. If you are thinking about switching to a magnetic stripe ticket system, call EDM for your ticketing requirements.


RFID Tags –

An RFID tag is an object that can be stuck on or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification using radiowaves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. Most RFID tags contain at least two parts.

One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and demodulating a (RF) signal and perhaps other specialized functions. The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal. A technology called chipless RFID allows for discrete identification of tags without an integrated circuit, thereby allowing tags to be printed directly onto assets at lower cost than traditional tags.
